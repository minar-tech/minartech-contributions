## MinarTech Contributions
Contribute by sending your own texts to MinarTech projects. The text committed here forms a **Repository**. The materials in the repository will be ingested to a thematically organised cumulative **Thematic Service**.

### Become a Member in a Team Working on a Theme
* The MinarTech project is focused on **Themes**. You can initiate a Theme or contribute to an existing one.
* Each Theme is managed by a Theme **Curator**. Before submitting a text, be in contact with the Curator for the Theme you are interested in. A list of Themes wil be provided here, but remember that you can initiate your own Theme.
* Your submission can be **Unverified** or **Reviewed** by experts. If you want to be accepted as a **Reviewer**, please let us know what your specialities are. To be accepted as a Reviewer for a specific Theme, you are required to have academic credentials and peer reviewed publications of your own.
* As many of thowe writing thext for the service are not writing in their primary language, there is a need for **Language Conrol** and Revision. You are welcome to participate in this role for you own language.

### How to Get Access
* To contribute, you will need a known person (called *recommender*) to recommend you.
* After the recommendation has arrived, you will receive a password.
* You can then log in to the repository and edit existing files of upload new files.
* The files must be in **markdown** format. Markdown is really simple to lean - it will take only a few minutes. A **Guide** will be provided here later. The Guide will also contain advice onconnecting to the Repository.
* You can also submit your texts without any formatting. Just separate paragraphs with blank lines - that's all.
* An experimental way to create files is tu use the free Dillinger editor at https://dillinger.io/. From the editor you can both pull files from the repository to edit them or push new or edited files to the repository. Once Dillinger is in a stable and more mature state, it will be a highly useful tool, but currently it is recommended, that you use a text editor on your own computer to create your texts.
